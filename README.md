Web application that won the first price for the All India Coding Competetion Organized by Stella Maris College, Chennai
This is a web application which was developed keeping in mind the hardships that teachers had to undergo during the lockdown times. The students who had a greater amount of technological know how was able to cheat in exams and assesments without getting caught. And even to catch one of these malpractises means that the teacher would have to spend a huge amount of time cross checking each and every assesment of every student. This web application deals with this problem by helping the teachers identify malpractises in both exams and assignments by using technology. 

The plaigarism checker implemented in this web application is capable of cross checking the assignment report of an individual student against multiple online platforms from which the content is suspected of being taken. The CopyCat module implemented is capable of checking the answer sheet submitted by an individual student against academic material distributed between the student and the answer sheets uploaded by other students and determining the percentage of Copying that has occured.

There is also another module called the question paper generator module that can generate a question paper based on the preset parameters from a set of questions in a manner that ensures complete coverage of the course modules as well as complete transparency of the process

This is build using Flask and Bootstrap
